                        <h3>Gimmick</h3>
                        <p>is a new synthesizer with a new synthesis method. It generates oscillator waveform by considering how many times to twist. Invented extremely by Juno Ju-X.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
                        <p>Super simply, Gimmick oscillator lets you draw a waveform as you like. And it plays the waveform as it's drawn. No pre-recorded samples or waveforms are inside. Then, it's easy to let a pointing device to draw something freely, however in this way, most of the results sound no musical, boring noises, or just shaggy sounds.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Gimmick oscillator is an invention, that plays musical noises, fat'n warm sounds and seriously ill sounds by just moving handle points. If the handles are not enough counts, you can increase them up to 11 that turn it complicated enough.</p>
                        
                        <h3>An advanced FM synthesis</h3>
                        <p>Gimmick got frequency modulation feature built-in that makes sounds glitter, futuristic, and spacy. Well known FM synthesizers use sine waveform, or something not so far shape form sine draws. As you know, you can draw a waveform with Gimmick oscillator, and you can use it as the carrier of FM synthesis!</p>
                        
                        <h3>Gimmick is Vital</h3>
                        <p>Synthesizer needs modulations to give the sound a birth. Gimmick's modulator section is made as semi-modular type, so you have freedom of connection choices. And the modulator has been designed uniquely for Gimmick oscillator. Now you can modulate any handle points fast or slow, vertically or horizontally, cyclic or random! In result, it won't keep playing a loop of sound.</p>
                        
                        <h3>You are even free from where sliders can reach!</h3>
                        <p>So I love freedom. You can set virtually any numbers that a Mac can recognize in the numerical boxes next to every slider. Usually programmers limit those inputs as freedom is so wider than we can really expect. But I didn't set the limits really. You can even set minus numbers for something can't go minus back, like a time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Still no real learning is required</h3>
                        <p>While Gimmick has been designed in unique ways, it is very easy to operate! especially if you are already on how to manipulate a subtractive synth. Easy operation, millions of possibility.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Try today</h3>
                        <p>Download Gimmick today, and hear the actual sounds:) There is a Demo limitation which is new and funny. It moves sliders automatically at random time at random range, like a baby sitting next to you abuses sliders! So you can't stay on a sound for some time while (sorry!), but this is good to bring you more variation of sounds! Once you are inspired with the sound of Gimmick, just purchase it as earlier as possible. I'm planning to raise the price by each version up, but won't charge any updating fee. So buying now is smallest to spend!</p>
