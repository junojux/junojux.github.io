        <p2>Introduction</p2><br/>
        Hosting AU microDAW is a micro-sized Digital Audio Workstation for Mac OSX that hosts Audio Unit instruments and effect plugins, comes with 4ch+1 mixer with external audio input, 32-bit recorder, music-typing kind of feature called as “LazyKey".<br/><br/>

        For who has <a href="http://ju-x.com/downloads/Sequera.dmg" style="color: #ffffdb;">Sequera</a> or a 3rd party MIDI sequencer, you can make any type of music that focuses on simplicity (for dancing or whatever!) super quickly. I mainly recommend Hosting AU to those who are:<br/><br/>

        <p2>Beginners (and who wants to teach them)</p2><br/>
        As Hosting AU is the simplest DAW available today, you’ll need to learn nothing more than very basic things such as what is a synth, what is a recording, what is MIDI etc.<br/><br/>

        <p2>Matured Musicians and Developers</p2><br/>
        As Hosting AU does the quickest job in every part from launching until quitting, plus it hosts even older plugins from Intel-era on Snow Leopard or later to the latest one, I believe that you'll find a use:) It does not "wrap" any, things are connected and run very straightly, so you’ll have best hosting result in terms of sonic quality, cpu+memory efficiency, and lowest latency too.<br/><br/>

        <p2>Serious Music Listeners</p2><br/>
        As Hosting AU supports Cycling 74’s SoundFlower (check their website, it’s free to grab also: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list" target="_blank" style="color: #ffffdb;">From Here</a>), you can virtually wire between Hosting AU and any other apps that uses audio. Good thing is that you can insert effects after the input, so for instance, you can listen to internet radio better through your quality plugins;)<br/><br/>

        <p2>Other Info</p2><br/>
        Hosting AU has only about 550KB for its size, surprisingly that could be stored in 2DD floppy diskette:D and as the app itself is all its content, you won’t have any worry to get it installed on your Mac. Just grab one today, and give it a try!<br/><br/>

        As Hosting AU hosts Audio Unit plugins, you can expand it with variety of plugins, firstly I recommend my <a href="http://ju-x.com/downloads/Gimmick.zip" style="color: #ffffdb;">Gimmick</a> synth to be installed, and also I know some of great plugins for free such as u-he’s TyrellN6, Futucraft’s Kairatune, Martinic's Combo Model F etc etc.<br/><br/>
        
        <p2>From v1.3</p2><br/>
        You can swap/copy plugins. Just drag a plugin slot, and drop to another slot (with option key to copy). Be sure that you can swap/copy between same type of plugins (instrument or effect). Also now Hosting AU accepts MIDI controllers to control the plugin parameters! Check "MIDI Controller Setting" menu under "Hosting AU" menu.<br/><br/>
        
        And "Music (almost!) non-stop", technically there's about 11ms gap of silence, but you can keep hearing sound while loading, swapping plugins. Plus, bunches of stability, crash-proof fixes are done, so if you experienced any crash before, please try this latest version today!<br><br/>
        
        <p2>From v1.3.8</p2><br/>
        I'm planning this version to be last one in this shape/condition. So don't miss to get one:) Now Hosting AU accepts any sample rate for output/input devices. Sample rates can be set in Audio MIDI Setup utility. And only when input device is on and it has different sample rate than output device, Hosting AU will use sample rate converter to match them. Also now it records and saves out 32-bit float wave file with the given sample rate. In other words, it will save exactly what's going on inside without conversions nor compressions. Changed level indicator to new one that consumes less cpu and has better visibility. Finally, for coming hot summer (on some part of earth), now you can select from gray opaque and smoky black translucent Core Window!<br><br/>
        
        <p2>Compatibility</p2><br/>
        Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard or later. (To use Hosting AU with older plugins, open it in 32-bit mode.)<br/><br/>
