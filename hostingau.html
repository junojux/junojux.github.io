                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>Hosting AU microDAW is a micro-sized Digital Audio Workstation for Mac OSX that hosts Audio Unit instruments and effect plugins, comes with 4ch+1 mixer with external audio input, 32-bit recorder, music-typing feature “LazyKey".</p>
                            
                            <p>With a MIDI sequencer, you can make any type of music that focuses on simplicity (for dancing or whatever!) super quickly. I mainly recommend Hosting AU to those who are:</p>
                            
                            <h4>Beginners (and who wants to teach them)</h4>
                            <p>As Hosting AU is the simplest DAW available today, you’ll need to learn nothing more than very basic things such as what is a synth, what is a recording, what is MIDI etc.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Matured Musicians and Developers</h4>
                            <p>As Hosting AU does the quickest job in every part from launching until quitting, plus it hosts even older plugins from Intel-era on Snow Leopard or later to the latest one, I believe that you'll find a use:) It does not "wrap" any, things are connected and run very straightly, so you’ll have best hosting result in terms of sonic quality, cpu+memory efficiency, and lowest latency too.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Serious Music Listeners</h4>
                            <p>As Hosting AU supports Cycling 74’s SoundFlower (check their website, it’s free to grab also: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/list" target="_blank">From Here</a>), you can virtually wire between Hosting AU and any other apps that uses audio. Good thing is that you can insert effects after the input, so for instance, you can listen to internet radio better through your quality plugins;)</p>
                            
                            <h3>Other Info</h3>
                            <p>Hosting AU has only about 600KB for its size, surprisingly that could be stored in 2DD floppy diskette:D and as the app itself is all its content, you won’t have any worry to get it installed on your Mac. Just grab one today, and give it a try!<br/><br/>
                            
                            As Hosting AU hosts Audio Unit plugins, you can expand it with variety of plugins, firstly I recommend my <a href="downloads/Gimmick.zip">Gimmick</a> synth to be installed. If you once like it, please buy one!</p>
                            
                            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
